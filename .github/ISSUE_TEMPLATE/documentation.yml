        This template is strictly used for documentation requests, including:

        - Elaborating on a particular topic;
        - Updating external links;
        - anything else that doesn't require touching the codebase itself.

        If you followed the documentation but things don't work, take some time to consider if it's the documentation or the code that's wrong. In the latter, prefer using the "bug" template.

        We seldom close documentation pull requests unmerged. If your documentation request is:

        - Relevant to a significant proportion of StoneDB users;
        - Not documented elsewhere (or, if it is documented, the mention is in very undiscoverable places).
